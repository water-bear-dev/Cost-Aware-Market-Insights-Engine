A working document detailing engineering decisions, feature updates, and architectural pivots as the Cost-Aware Market Insights Engine evolves.

## Entry 1: Shifting gears to the Local MVP

*Date: 2026-03-27*

Initially, our roadmap established an aggressive push directly into AWS. Phase 1 included immediately writing CloudFormation templates and spinning up ECS Fargate instances alongside Amazon API Gateways using Cloud Map VPC links. While the architecture was "cost-optimized" by deferring expensive NAT gateways to Phase 5, the timeline forced us into relying on an active AWS billing account starting from commit zero.

**The Pivot:** We updated our overarching `system_overview.md` to consolidate the roadmap from 5 stages down to 4. We introduced **Phase 1: Fully Local MVP**. This allows us to prove our core differentiator exactly zero dollars down. 

By building a local `docker-compose.yml` framework alongside `amazon/dynamodb-local`, we constructed our core backend Python logic—the automated `APScheduler` loop, `yfinance` data extraction algorithms, `pydantic` schemas, and crucial `boto3` wrappers—without locking a single credential.

## Entry 2: Enforcing FinOps Guardrails 

*Date: 2026-03-27*

With the structural base implemented, we tackled the primary function of the engine: Cost-Aware AI interaction. Generative models like AWS Bedrock's Claude 3 Haiku charge per token. A runaway system parsing heavy market headlines continuously could easily spike a massive bill. 

We constructed `src/cost_tracking/service.py` which tracks daily spend exactly how an enterprise ledger would. When `src/synthesis/service.py` operates, it doesn't just call Bedrock arbitrarily. It builds the prompt size, multiplies by the configured Token Rate (e.g., $0.00025 per 1K Input Tokens), grabs the `get_daily_spend()` amount out of the DynamoDB ledger, and blocks the request entirely if the calculation exceeds the user's `$5.00` `DAILY_BUDGET_USD` environment variable.

For Phase 1, we implemented the entire algorithm locally, logging simulated "local-mock" Bedrock expenditures into the database. Now, when Phase 2 moves us into live Bedrock execution, our wallet is perfectly protected. 

## Entry 3: Surfacing Analytics via the Dashboard

*Date: 2026-03-27*

Building an API is fantastic, but visualizing data makes it real. We requested the system natively serve a single-page application from the root endpoint (`/`). 

In `static/index.html` and `static/style.css`, we implemented a premium visual layout. Relying heavily on modern dark-mode aesthetics, custom "glassmorphic" card utilities, dynamic gradient text, and precise padding grids. The custom vanilla `app.js` runs a 15-second polling loop grabbing `/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/costs`, and `/api/v1/insights`. 

It gracefully renders out exactly how much our mock AI is costing the system against the predefined threshold limits inside of a sleek Budget Utilization progress bar. It then loops over the successfully generated stock insights combining the real Yahoo Finance price action closures directly alongside the mock LLM output.

**What's next?**
Phase 2! The foundational algorithms and cost-gate algorithms are stable. The next goal is executing AWS CloudFormation to secure an ECS perimeter and wiring in Anthropic's Claude to read the real Yahoo Finance news feeds on our live UI.

## Entry 4: Aggregating Live Market News

*Date: 2026-03-27*

While `yfinance` provides excellent ticker pricing data, we wanted the Insights Engine to synthesize the latest, most relevant market news from a variety of sources. 

We updated `src/ingestion/service.py` to ping the Google News RSS feed for each ticker during the ingestion cycle. We parse the XML tree using the built-in `xml.etree.ElementTree` to extract the single most relevant aggregated headline from top financial publishers (Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, etc.) across the web.

This unified headline is then packaged into the DynamoDB `MarketData` item and injected directly into our Phase 1 mock-synthesis response, displaying live news straight on the frontend dashboard without spending a dime on paid news APIs.

## Entry 5: Bridging the Cloud MVP via Bedrock and CloudFormation

*Date: 2026-03-27*

Phase 2 officially pulls the Insights Engine into AWS! Since our foundational local FinOps budget gates were successfully tested in Phase 1, we aggressively updated `src/synthesis/service.py` to implement the `boto3` Bedrock Runtime client. The Python service now automatically packs our aggregated Yahoo Finance / Google News context into an Anthropic Messages API payload, invoking `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0` to synthesize stunning, concise market updates. 

Furthermore, we shifted the architecture off Docker Desktop into Infrastructure-as-Code. We created `infra/cloudformation.yml` defining exactly what the application needs to run in the cloud. We implemented `scripts/deploy.sh` to package, push, and stack the environment gracefully in a single terminal click!

**Lessons from the Cloud:** 
Deployment isn't always linear. We hit two real-world AWS hurdles that we quickly pivoted to solve:
1. **STS Global Endpoints:** Our local terminal environment had trouble resolving global AWS endpoints. Setting an explicit `--region us-east-1` for identity checks solved the connection stall.
2. **ECS Service Linked Roles:** We discovered that in fresh AWS accounts, the `AWSServiceRoleForECS` must be propagated before CloudFormation can successfully spin up Fargate clusters. We verified the role's existence and purged the failed "dead" stack to allow a clean, successful retry.
